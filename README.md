🎉 Welcome to the community-driven, unofficial browser extension for Mercari! Enhancing your Mercari experience, one feature at a time.

## 🌟 About the Project
Mercari makes buying and selling a breeze, but we've all bumped into those little bugs that can be a tad bit annoying. That's where the Mercari Enhancement Suite steps in - fixing what's bugging you and adding a sprinkle of extra features for a smoother experience!

### Why This Project Rocks:
- Fixes known issues not yet addressed by Mercari.
- Regularly updated to keep up with Mercari's latest version.
- Community-driven – your ideas help shape the future of this extension!

## 📸 The Problem: Blurry Photos, Be Gone!
Ever uploaded a photo on Mercari and found it mysteriously blurred? You're not alone. This extension started as a fix to the image quality issue – a small tweak with a big impact!

## 🚀 How It Works
Staying ahead of the curve, we've got a CI/CD pipeline that tests and deploys updates, ensuring compatibility with the newest Mercari versions. 

### Heads Up! 
Occasionally, you might notice a release marked as 'failed.' Don't worry, it's all part of the plan! These are typically updates to the libraries used for building the extension, not changes to Mercari's end. So, the core functionality remains steady as a rock.
